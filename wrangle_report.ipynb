    "The dataset that I cleaned and analised is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.  Why? ```◖ᵔᴥᵔ◗``` Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\"  [```# knowyourmeme```][1] \n",

    "\n",
    "I started with the WeRateDogs twitter archive, which has been provided to me as a .csv file. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contained though: each tweet's text, which was used to extrac rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced\".\n",
    "\n",
    "I programmatically downloaded a tweet image prediction file with a URL that I received. The results: a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered from Twitter's API. Well, \"anyone\" who has access to data for the 3000 most recent tweets, at least. But I, because I had the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, I was able to gather this data for all 5000+. And guess what? I queried Twitter's API to gather this valuable data using the Tweepy library."

    "On the other hand, we encountered with untidy data, which is more reffered to messy and not-user-friendly data. The information may be complete, valid, accurate and consistent, but it is not readable, cannot be analised an/or cannot be matched with other datasets. Meaning, in general, issues with data structure or semantics. We learned that *Each variable must have its own column, each observation must have its own row, and each type of observational unit should be stored in its own table.*"

    "To begin, I decided to check the behavior of the followers of WeRateDogs while I was running the twitter API. By the starting point, the accound had the maximum followers count for the period, with 8.772.134 followers, and this number fluctuated during the following minutes by 751 points, going up and down, being the minimum 8.771.383 followers by the end of this period. The odd thing about this is how many times it went 751 points up and down in so few minutes. It was like 751 people were playing with the \"follow\" button te see how many spikes I would have in my chart."

After just a couple of months that number dropped cosiderably and stayed between 20 and 50 rates every 2 weeks for the next few years.
